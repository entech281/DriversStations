This is the Arduino sketch for the simpliest case.  It tracks
up to 13 buttons and 4 analog axes.

The code for buttons 10 & 12 are designed for a 3 position
switch where the bottom button activated is "off", middle
position is ramp deployment, and the top position is lift
ramp.  The middle and top positions should not be on at the
same time.
